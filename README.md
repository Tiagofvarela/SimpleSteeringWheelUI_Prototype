# Simple Steering Wheel UI Prototype

Developed by Manuel Tomás, Rui Fartaria, Tiago Varela, Tomás Branco for a University Human Computer Interaction course focused on paper prototyping and data gathering from user tests.

This page hosts the HTML, CSS, and Javascript implementation component of the project.

## Explanation

The project implements a web mockup of a design idea for a steering wheel controlled car screen. 

The mockup features were part of specific tests and prototype demonstration for class, and hence most features aren't fully featured and were made expecting to only work under certain conditions.

The web component of the project hosted here serves mostly as a simple training exercise for the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.
